## Context
- This role sat within Business Process Operations and Analytics, partnering closely with Customer Support, Technical Support, Content Management, and Leadership teams

- The role existed to build reliable analytics foundations, enable self-serve decision making, and drive operational efficiency and customer experience improvements

## Problems Owned
- Solved Data Accuracy challenges in reporting layer by building an auditable, reliable and scalable data model in Power BI. This included syncing and organizing data from multiple data sources like, Salesforce, MS SQL Server, Genesys, Web traffic from GCP, Excel/CSV.   

- Built reliable Self-Serve Analytics module using Power BI where users can fetch the data of their choice at thier convenience without reaching out to data or analytics team for support. This eliminated 95% adhoc requests from the stakeholders and end users.

- Worked with Knowledge Center Management team to identify and classify 35000+ internal vs publicly available content based on usage to clean the stale content and push relevant content. This began as a cleanup activity and later expanded into designing the Content Knowledge Center as data hub for training Chatbots.

- Presented actoinable insights into business operations in weekly, monthly and quarterly business reviews. Driving actions by tracking metrics like Case Volume, CSAT, NPS, ReOpen Rate, First Response Time (FRT), First Closure Rate (FCR), Average Handling Time (AHT), Average Speed to Answer (ASA) across voice, chat and email support.

- Enabled Workforce management team to accurately moitor the resource availability for planning and scheduling effective support. Merged data tracking from Workday with Genesys and Salesforce CRM through Data Modeling in SQL Server and Power BI to ensure cross platform data availability in common place to take faster decisions, without having to juggle b/w dashboards and tools.

## Key Initiatives / Projects
- Redisgned the scoring system of support engineers leaderboard. Moved away from z-score system, which was penalizing the bottom performers, to a neutral scaling system which gave reward for their contribution without subtracting. Influenced the senior stakeholders (Directors and above) to adopt the new scoring system by data backed example. This became most used internal data product in the organization with 100+ daily active user. 

- Owned dashboard migration from Tableau to Power BI for 3 buisness units - technical support, customer support, digital experience (web traffic analytics +  chatbot analytics). Led the team of 3 data analysts and mentor them during this project. Identified 120 dashboards deployed on Tableau Server, categorized them into high level business unit requirements, Consolidated these dashboards into 1 comprehensive dashboard answering all questions for each business unit. We ended up having only 3 dashboards in Power BI at the end of this project.

- Designed the Analaytical Data Model in MS SQL Server for various Buiness Units. Worked with Data Engineering team to build reliable and reusable datasets for consistent reporting and high performance. Defined the metrics, schema, partitions and indexes. 

- Automated Backlog case tracking to enable close monitoring of aging cases and take proactive actions to close pending cases. Reduced backlogs from 21% to 13% in in 3 months, reduced avg case age of backlog from 30 to 12 days. Earlier it was tracked in Excel and took 1 day to get the numbers out, I moved the entire logic into the Customer Support Power BI dashboard.

## Impact & Outcomes
- Eliminated 95% adhoc data request by build a trustworthy self-serve data product 

- Consolidated Dashboard swarm into Business Unit specific dashboards answering actionable questions (from 120 to 3 dashboards)

- Rebuilt trust in data by developing with stakeholders involved during the data validation phase, eliminating any assumptions and documenting the definitions and logical calcutaions for future reference. Enabled Git to version control the changes to avoid conflict.
